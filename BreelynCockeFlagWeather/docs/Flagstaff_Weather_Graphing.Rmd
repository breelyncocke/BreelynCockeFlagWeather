We see that the amount of snow per year varies, with missing data in the 1990s. 
The maximum snowfall recorded is just before 1970.

The relationship between minimum and maximum temperatures vary as expected, with
higher maximums associated with higher minimums, and vice versa. The coldest 
minimum is just above -25 degrees Farenheit while the maximum temperature is just
below 100 degrees Farenheit.

The maximum precipitation is just below 4 inches around 1990.
